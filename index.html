                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>Hi, I’m Ceina, currently completing my undergraduate degree in applied computer science at the Dominican University of California. 
                    Previously, I earned a Bachelor's in Human Resource Management from Baruch College. I decided to switch careers because I’ve always 
                    had a passion for computers but wasn’t sure where to start until I discovered General Assembly. 
                    The bootcamp taught me a lot about the world of Software Engineering. After completing the bootcamp, I took some time to focus on my family. 
                    Now, I’ve been given the opportunity to pursue my passion and further my education at my current school. I’m excited to re-enter the world of 
                    computer science, continue developing my skills, and gain the knowledge necessary to succeed. 
                    </p>
